Right now, I'm developing the code for the game engine.  Everything in the world itself, like the areas and the items, exist solely as contrived situations to test that code as I develop it.  Development of the world itself will come after the engine is working and optimal.

The general "architecture" of the code is:
Globals -> Utilities -> Item -> Player -> Menu -> Location -> Locations -> Game

Started on December 5th, 2012.  Many thanks to Daniel Scanlan, who figured out the cause of a bug that would have killed this project early on had he not caught it.

To-do:
-Move the code that checks whether a file exists already to the saveGame(); it has room for it.  Have it return a status, and if it returns an error, have playGame() set the filename variable equal to "".
-Consolidate the common code in the save and load functions.
-Add code to prompt the player to save before quitting if they didn't do so last turn.
