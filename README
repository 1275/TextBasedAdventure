Right now, I'm developing the code for the game engine.  Everything in the world itself, like the areas and the items, exist solely as contrived situations to test that code as I develop it.  Development of the world itself will come after the engine is working and optimal.

The general "architecture" of the code is:
Globals -> Utilities -> Item -> Player -> Menu -> Location -> Locations -> Game

Started on December 5th, 2012.  Many thanks to Daniel Scanlan, who figured out the cause of a bug that would have killed this project early on had he not caught it.

To-do:
-Make the save functionality check whether such a savefile exists and ask if the player would like to override it (or check if it exists and isn't a save file, in which case don't allow the save).
-Make the error messages use cout, rather than display. (That way they don't depend on display() working correctly.)
