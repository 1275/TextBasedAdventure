With the first draft of the game's engine now finished, I've started developing the game's world.

If you would like to get a feel for the general "architectre" of the code, you should read the files in the following order (or in reverse order if you want to understand it in a top-down way):
Globals.h
Utilities.h/.cpp
Item.h
Player.h/.cpp
Menu.h/.cpp
WorldVariables.h/.cpp
Action.h/.cpp
Location.h/.cpp
Game.h/.cpp
Main.cpp

Started on December 5th, 2012.  Many thanks to Mike McG who encouraged me to put this project on GitHub and who encouraged me to not settle for "good enough" when there was room for improvement.  Thanks to Daniel Scanlan, who figured out the cause of a bug that would have killed this project early on had he not caught it.

Notes for developer:

To-do:
-Make the save and load functions for WorldVariables account for reaching the end of a load file, so you don't need to start over every time you add new variables to the struct.
-Make a dialog function that displays a line of dialog, given to the function via a string as function input, and then calls enterToContinue().  Call is something short like dialog() to make it convenient to use.  Use it in the dialog inside the Elffor tavern.
(Maybe)
-Make the WorldVars variable an element of Location, now that Location can be used without the need to delete it and make a new one.
-Improve the layout of variables in the Action class.
-Give Location an assignment operator so Game::playGame() can use a stack variable rather than a heap (new) one.
