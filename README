I've finished developing the code for the game engine.  Presently, everything in the world itself, i.e. the locations and the items, are contrived situations that existed to test the code as I was developing it.  Development of the world itself will start soon.

The general "architecture" of the code is:
Globals -> Utilities -> Item -> Player -> Menu -> Location -> Locations -> Game

Started on December 5th, 2012.  Many thanks to Daniel Scanlan, who figured out the cause of a bug that would have killed this project early on had he not caught it.

Notes for developer

To-do:
Change all the while-loops that have a manual break at the end into do-while-loops.

Progression of items:
Rusty Sword
Lantern
Bow
Bombs
Bandit's Sword (allows defense against more deft foes)
Grappling Hook
[Modified] Bow (capable of attaching lantern for fire arrows)
Crossbow (capable of shooting bomb arrows)
Sanctified Sword (allows defense against very powerful foes)
